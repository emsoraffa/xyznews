                    <h2>Playstation shortages</h2>
                <p class="article">Hardware shortages across the world have affected industries of all stripes. 
                    PC gamers were hit particularly hard with parts shortages, which also affected console manufacturing. 
                    Sony's latest console, the PlayStation 5 has been notoriously difficult to get a hold of, and that doesn't look likely 
                    to normalise until around 2024.</p>

                <br/>
                <p class="article">A rough second quarter in the market will come to an end next week,
                     but not before big earnings reports from Nike (NYSE:NKE) and Micron (NASDAQ:MU) land on the laps of investors. 
                     The economic calendar includes updates on durable goods orders on June 27, 
                     home prices on June 28, GDP on June 29, PMI on June 30, and construction spending on July 1. 
                     Near the end of the week, oil traders will be watching the OPEC+ meeting to see if the 
                     plan is to proceed with the targeted August oil production increase against a backdrop 
                     of high prices and limited spare capacity for some members.</p>
